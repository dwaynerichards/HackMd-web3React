# HackMd-web3React

Uses ethers.js to instantiate and querry an instance of the USDC ETHER Uniswap on the ethereum blockchain.

Each swap in the pool, post miner consensys, is displayed via a React front end.
Attempts were made to useContext in conjuction with web3React but I settled on hooks.

Users may connect their ethereum wallet, assuming the wallet uses the windows.etherum.
